\subsection{Third parties involved in the project (including use of third party resources)}

Only participants with third parties involved in the project are listed below.

Does the participant plan to subcontract certain tasks (please note that core
tasks of the project should not be sub-contracted) & No\\\hline

 \textit{If yes, please describe and justify the tasks to be subcontracted}

third parties & Yes\\\hline

 \multicolumn{2}{|p{\textwidth}|}{\textit{\textbf{The University of Strasbourg} (UNISTRA) is 
 one of the largest universities in  France, with over 46000 students and over 4000 
 researchers. The University also offers 
 access to 25 modern languages, multinational diplomas, jointly supervised doctorates, 
 upholding renowned international postgraduate schools and student exchange agreements. 
 The scale of research activity at Strasbourg is substantial, involving 10 doctoral schools and 
 73 research units and 6 research federations covering a broad range of disciplines. UNISTRA is linked to
 CNRS-ObAS via a signed Convention de site. Dr. Sebastien DERRIERE and Mr. Thomas 
 BOCH are employed by Universite de Strasbourg and work in the Centre de Donnees 
 astronomique de Strasbourg (CDS) within The Strasbourg Observatory (ObAS), a Joint Research 
 Unit of CNRS and Universite
 de Strasbourg.}}\\\hline

\textit{\textbf{Uniwersytet Slaski} have much experience in academic 
research based on 3d visualisation software for fluid dynamics. However, the expertise in 
computer graphics, especially  WebGL, is not enough at the Department of Mathematics, 
Physics and Chemistry. Instead of building such an expertise, it is financially more 
efficient to specify and outsource the programming task to professionals. The subcontracting 
will cover work done in the development od K3D-jupyter package, and it will be performed 
under supervision of leadPI.}
