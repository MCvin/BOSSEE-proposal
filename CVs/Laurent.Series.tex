\begin{participant}[type=R,PM=2,gender=male]{Laurent Series}

    Laurent Series is Research Engineer in scientific computing at CMAP (Centre 
    de Mathématiques Appliquées) which is a Joint Research Unit
    (UMR7641) of the CNRS and \'Ecole polytechnique. He works on several
    scientific computing open-source projects in different fields like
    finite element method for solid mechanics, multiresolution for 
    reaction-diffusion equations modeling multi-scale reaction wave ...
  
    He was technical responsible of Computing Center (M\'esocentre) of Ecole
    CentraleSup\'elec from 2009 to 2018. In this context, he organises and 
    participates in the user support team (assistance in porting codes, 
    parallelization, vectorisation, optimisation). Since his arrival at \'Ecole 
    Polytechnique, he is involved in the process of creation of a new Computing 
    Center.
    
    For several years, he has been very involved in promoting the Jupyter project
    by writing Jupyter notebooks for course (such as "Dynamical systems for the 
    modeling and simulation of multi-scale reacting media" MAP551) and by promoting, 
    among researchers, its use to share their work. He is also involved with the 
    direction of \'Ecole polytechnique for the project of building an infrastructure 
    for Jupyter at the level of the school, for its use in both research and teaching.
