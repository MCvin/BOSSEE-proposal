  The aim of this task (see page
  \pageref{sec:concept-demonstrator-math} for context)
  is to build on this experience to further
  develop and promote the use of Jupyter widgets for interactive
  Mathematics. This will include the following actions:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Engage with the community through tutorials, workshops, online
    discussions, for codesign and for dissemination of the outcomes.
  \item Tackle hurdles to real-time interactivity, typically by
    modernizing the existing 2D and 3D visualization tools in
    SageMath. % E.g.: We don't use Matplotlib's integration in Jupyter
  \item Bring \software{sage-combinat-widgets} and
    \software{sage-explorer} from usable prototypes to standard tools,
    and further contribute to the development of the \software{Francy}
    framework.
  \item Develop other generic mathematical widgets according to the
    users popular requests.
  \item Demonstrate the value all of the above through applications in
    research and teaching.
  \item Publish selected demonstration notebooks for interactive use on
    \TheProject's EOSC services (\delivref{applications}{demonstrators}).
  \end{compactitem}
  The work carried out will be reported on in
  \delivref{applications}{applications-report}.
