  Improving the accessibility of Jupyter software
  is important to ensuring the value of \TheProject reaches and appropriately supports
  the broadest community.
  In particular, we should take advantage of established guidelines (such as a11y) and
  technologies to ensure that people with visual impairments can make full use
  of the software.
  This includes considerations such as font size and contrast ratios,
  as well as ensuring that the interface can be used with a screen reader,
  for people who cannot use a conventional display screen.

  Working with the community and UI accesibility experts, we will audit the accessibility 
  of Jupyter software and assemble a roadmap for improved accessibility
  (\localdelivref{accessibility-report}),
  and ultimately work to improve the accessibility of Jupyter software,
  starting with JupyterHub (\localdelivref{accessibility}).
