  The objectives of this work package are
 \begin{compactitem}
   \item to guide the development of core tools by simultaneously
     developing and using applications in diverse fields with active
     scientists from these fields, and
   \item demonstrate that the tools we develop are valuable to diverse
     fields of science, thus ensuring we develop e-infrastructure and
     services which can cater for a broad customer base of EOSC.
 \end{compactitem}
\end{wpobjectives}

\begin{wpdescription}

  In order to ensure that the work we do is beneficial to science and
  society, we will develop applications as EOSC services in diverse domains, using the
  components developed in work packages \WPref{core} and
  \WPref{ecosystem}.

  By developing applications simultaneously with the core
  infrastructure and services, we ensure that we are serving
  real-world use cases with our development.  Feedback from
  applications development can guide development of core features.  In
  addition to helping ensure that our work is useful to the chosen
  application domains, the showcases serve as demonstrations of
  this utility.

  One of the key aspects of Jupyter that make it the choice for
  \TheProject, is that it is generic, based on open protocols and
  widely useful in diverse domains, from physics to life sciences to
  education and the global community working with public and private
  data. We have selected a number of applications in a variety of domains
  to demonstrate the broad impact of \TheProject, in particular in the
  areas of education (\localtaskref{teaching}), photon science and
  imaging (\localtaskref{reproducibility-xfel}), astronomy
  (\localtaskref{astro}), geosciences (\localtaskref{geoscience}), 
  fluid dynamics (\localtaskref{application-gpu}), 
  mathematics (\localtaskref{math}) and health (\localtaskref{opendose-analysis}).

  \medskip
  Our demonstrators will typically follow a two-stage design: (i)
  development and testing of the functionality in Jupyter Notebook
  with local execution of the services at the developing partner
  site. (ii) Making the service available through the European Open
  Science Cloud (EOSC).

  For step (ii), we will deliver base-line services by making the
  relevant notebooks executable in the MyBinder instance that this
  project will contribute to EOSC. This is sufficient to demonstrate
  the Jupyter service features such as reproducibility, interactive
  widget use and visualisation, and to demonstrate how these can
  enable new open science on EOSC.

  The particular workflows, data infrastructures and data policies for
  FAIR sharing of data vary a lot from one community and use-case to
  the other, or may not be fully defined yet. Therefore, this proposal
  does not enforce a specific way of handling with data. Instead we
  will explore in the demonstrator tasks how existing data policies,
  infrastructure and workflows can be respected and integrated with
  authentication and authorisation, data management, and
  JupyterHub/Binder services on EOSC in the future. EGI is a partner
  for all the tasks in this work packages and will work with us to
  find the best integration opportunities in the evolving EOSC
  infrastructure.

  For some of the demonstrators, such as the photon science and
  astronomy demonstrators, we will collaborate with other projects
  such as PaNOSC and ESCAPE in which authentication and authorisation
  and data management are addressed for those domains already.
