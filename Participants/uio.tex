\begin{sitedescription}{UIO} \label{desc:UIO}

The University of Oslo (UiO) is Norway's oldest institution for research and higher education, with 28,000 students and 6,000 employees. UiO has 8 faculties, 2 museums and several centres. In addition, UiO has 10 Norwegian Centres of Excellence,  is ranked as the world's 62nd university, and has had 5 Nobel prize laureates. UiO aims to become an international hub for the research-based integration of computing into science education and has financed a university-wide hosting service for Jupyter notebooks through JupyterHub  to introduce a computational aspect to all curriculum programs in all science disciplines from bachelor to postdoctoral studies.

The University of Oslo is a Silver Partner to \href{https://carpentries.org}{The Carpentries}, an international successful community driven project with Instructors, Trainers, Maintainers, helpers, and supporters who share a mission to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers.

The Department of Geosciences of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences is the broadest geoscience research-based teaching environment in Norway, and covers a wide range of disciplines from deep mantle processes to atmospheric sciences. It is organised in five sections and an administrative unit and supports two main strategic research initiatives:

- Land-Atmosphere Interactions in Cold Environments (\href{https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/research/groups/latice/}{LATICE})

- Interface Dynamics in Geophysical Flows (\href{https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/research/groups/earthflows/}{EarthFlows})


 The geosciences department has several large research projects financed by \href{https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Home_page/1177315753906}{The Research Council of Norway}, EU and Norwegian companies.

 The University of Oslo aims to manage research data according to international standards, such as the \href{https://www.uio.no/for-ansatte/arbeidsstotte/fa/forskningsdata/fair-data/index.html}{FAIR principles}\footnote{Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable}, and thereby support the development of a global research community in which research data is widely shared.
 Since November 2017, UiO’s policy follows the "open as standard" principle in respect of access to research data \cite{datapolicy-uio}.

\subsubsection*{Relevant projects or activities}

\begin{compactenum}
\item \href{https://coderefinery.org}{CodeRefinery} \label{desc:coderefinery} (2016-2021): 


The goal of this project is to provide students and researchers with infrastructure and training in the necessary tools and techniques to create sustainable, modular, reusable, and reproducible software.
This is a project within the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (\href{https://neic.no}{NeIC}), an organisational unit under \href{https://www.nordforsk.org/en}{NordForsk}.
NeIC is a Platinium Partner to \href{https://carpentries.org}{The Carpentries}.

The result of this project is a set of software development e-infrastructure solutions, coupled with necessary technical expertise and extensive training and on-boarding activities, training material and best practices guides which together form a Nordic platform for research groups and institutes to develop a better collaboration on software and thereby to catalyze reproducible research and collaboration.

The University of Olso is a CodeRefinery partner and will ensure the complementarity of the two projects thus avoiding potential fragmentation. \TheProject will benefit from all this experience as well as the estbalished network in the Nordic Countries and beyond to fully realize the potential of \TheProject EOSC services.

\item Nordic Collaboration on e-Infrastructures for Earth System Modeling (\href{https://neic.no/nicest}{NICEST}, 2017-2019) \label{desc:nicest}:

This project aims at networking, intensifying existing collaboration, and facilitating 
joint work on very specific topics helping, for example, building up knowledge and
competency, and harmonising certain procedures concerning e-Infrastructure topics.

\item \href{https://uiohive.github.io/Hive/}{UiOHive} (2018-2019) \label{desc:uiohive}: 

UiOHive provides a vital and novel competence at the Union of Internet of Things (IoT), Microcontroller / Hardware development, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, and Data Science to enhance and strengthen collaboration between domains at the application of the aforementioned technologies. and the disciplines with competence to further develop technologies.
The purpose of GEOHive is to establish a central knowledge hub, centered around individuals interested in utilizing IoT technologies, applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to data challenges, and sharing knowledge across relevant interdisciplinary domains.

\item \href{https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/research/groups/latice/}{LATICE} (Land-ATmosphere Interactions in Cold Environments, 2015-2022): 
LATICE aims to advance the knowledge base concerning land atmosphere interactions and their role in controlling climate variability and climate change at high northern latitudes.

\item \href{https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/research/groups/earthflows/}{EarthFlows} (Interface Dynamics in Geophysical Flows, 2015-2022): 
The dynamics of interface processes during flows on Earth, including the geosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, and the atmosphere, including the behavior of the complex interfaces separating ‘Fluid Earth’ from ‘Solid Earth’.

The goal for the EarthFlows project is to provide fundamentally new understanding of the dynamics of fluid-solid interfaces for a number of important geophysical systems.

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}

\begin{compactenum}

\item \href{http://www.uh-iaas.no/}{Infrastructure as a Service}: the University of Oslo is part of the Norwegian Cloud Infrastructure for Research and Education and provide researchers with compute and storage medium-size resources. These include multi-GPUs clusters for big data analysis. The department of Geosciences is heavily relying on this services both for teaching and research work.

\item \href{https://sigma2.no}{UNINETT Sigma-2}: UNINETT Sigma2 manages the national infrastructure for computational science in Norway and offers services in High Performance Computing (HPC) and Data Storage and data analysis (Research Platform as a Cloud Service). The services are organized into infrastructural activities, financed by the Research Council of Norway and the Sigma2 consortium partners, which are the universities in Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø.

Services are freely available to individuals and groups involved in  research and education at Norwegian universities and colleges, and other organizations and project funded with public money. Cost efficient development, procurement, coordination and operation of the national e-infrastructure for research and education is the main focus for Sigma2.

The Department of Geosciences (University of Oslo) has been granted access to over 2 petabytes and several millions of CPU hours on the Norwegian High-Performance computers.
