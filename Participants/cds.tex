\begin{sitedescription}{CDS}

The Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg (ObAS) is a Joint Research Unit
(UMR7550) of the CNRS and of the Université de Strasbourg. ObAS hosts the 
Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg (Strasbourg astronomical Data 
Centre CDS, http://cds.unistra.fr). Since its creation in 1972, the CDS has 
been providing reference services which are widely used by the world-wide 
astronomical community with more than 1 million queries/day on average in 
2017. The CDS is labelled as a Research Infrastructure in the French national
Research Infrastructure Roadmap. Since 2006 CDS has been the coordinator,
on behalf of the CNRS, of all the projects funded by the European Commission
to support the implementation of European Virtual Observatory.
