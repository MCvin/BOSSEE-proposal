\begin{sitedescription}{EP}

\'Ecole Polytechnique (l'X), is the leading member of Grandes \'Ecoles in France
for science and technology according to all French rankings last year, ranked
2nd best small university in the world by Times Higher Education in 2018, and
16th best European university by QS World University Rankings in 2018. With
fewer than 3000 Bachelor, Masters, and PhD students enrolled at any time, the
institution has produced 4 Fields Medalists, 4 Nobel prize winners, and 3 French
presidents, ranking it 6th worldwide in terms of number of Nobel prize
recipients. L'X is composed of 22 laboratories supporting research in physics,
engineering, mathematics, biology, and chemistry (among others) and is connected
to several French national research institutions such as CNRS, CEA, and INRIA.
L'X prides itself on promoting multidisciplinary research through collaboration
between its many labs and with external, national and international partners and
a strong connection with industry and start-up.

The Mathematics department at Ecole polytechnique has started a reform of their
various teaching offer based on Jupyter for two years and several courses of the
Bachelor program, 2nd and 3rd year of Engineering school and Master program have
already begun relying on a strong use of Jupyter notebooks /
JupyterHub\footnote{\url{http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~massot/Personal_web_page_of_Marc_Massot/MAP551}} and this will continue with a strong support of the Dean of
undergraduate studies and of graduate studies. Besides several software and
research engineers in applied mathematics have been recruited and participate in
this effort, as well as a administration engineer in order to help in terms of
building an infrastructure dedicated to Jupyter with the support of the head of
the Ecole polytechnique in order to disseminate the effort into various other
departments (Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Biology...), where already some
courses are starting based in Jupyter. The link with the computer science club
of students of Ecole polytechnique (Binet R\'eseau) has also been created with
the project and a community is emerging.

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}

\site{UPSUD} hosts a local OpenStack based cloud infrastructure
\software{Cloud@VD}. \site{EP} invested last year in the purchase of 100 cores for this infrastructure in order to study how to deploy JupyterHub and BinderHub and start to offer to researchers and students this kind of service.
In 2019, \site{EP} will have a new infrastructure based on OpenShift with 200-300 cores dedicated to teaching using Jupyter.
